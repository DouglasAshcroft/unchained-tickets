1. Create a “dev” user through a trusted channel
   Run a one-off seed/CLI command (never a UI shortcut) that inserts a user into the database with:
   email you control
   strong hashed password (use the same bcrypt helper the app already uses)
   role = 'dev'
   Keep the script out of the repo; treat it like infrastructure code that you run once per environment.
2. Map your Base wallet to that user
   If you want wallet-based sign-in, add a table linking user.id → wallet.address, and populate it for your dev account.
   Require a signed message from the wallet (SIWE or similar) the first time you attach it, so you’re not trusting an environment variable alone.
   On subsequent logins, resolve the wallet address to its user record and return the stored role (dev).
3. Issue tokens server-side
   When the backend signs a JWT (or whatever session token you use), include both the user ID and role.
   The venue dashboard (and any API) should trust only that token; no client-side shortcuts, no .env role overrides.
4. Keep secrets out of docs and source
   .env should hold the seed email/password or wallet address if needed, but never the plain password—and certainly nothing in README/dev guides.
   Rotate secrets whenever you re-run the seed, and avoid committing .env or seed scripts.
5. Enforce RBAC on the server
   Extend the existing gate so server middleware checks the role from the token before returning venue data or rendering the dashboard.
   Client-side checks stay for UX, but the real enforcement happens in API/SSR code.
   With that in place you’ll log in once via email/password or wallet challenge, get a token that says role: dev, and the venue dashboard plus APIs will respect it. No privileged path baked into documentation, and no assumptions that a wallet address in .env equals access.

I'm not as fimiluar with the back end, I will need a more complete and spefic step by step walk through or if that reveal secrets in your logs, you can give me instrutions that I can drop in a Chat GPT prompt that will provide the detailed steps needed.

Here’s a secured workflow you can follow (and hand to any teammate) to create a privileged “dev” account without exposing secrets or hard‑coding backdoors.

Step 0 – Prereqs
Make sure you can run backend scripts locally (npm install, npm run prisma:generate already done).
Environment variables (like DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET) should be set in your local .env; never commit them.
Step 1 – Add a private seeding helper (local only)
Create a one-time script (e.g., scripts/create-dev-user.ts) that:

Reads the dev email/password from environment variables (e.g., DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL, DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD).
Never embed the values in the script.
Uses bcrypt.hash(password, 12) to generate a hash.
Inserts/updates the User record with role = 'dev'.
Inserts/updates the AuthCredential (provider = 'password') with the hashed password.
Optionally maps the wallet (Step 3) if you want to do it in the same run.
Example pseudocode:

import { prisma } from '@/lib/db/prisma';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

async function main() {
const email = process.env.DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL;
const password = process.env.DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD;
if (!email || !password) throw new Error('Missing dev admin creds');

const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

const user = await prisma.user.upsert({
where: { email },
update: { role: 'dev', name: 'Dev Admin' },
create: { email, role: 'dev', name: 'Dev Admin' },
});

await prisma.authCredential.upsert({
where: { userId_provider: { userId: user.id, provider: 'password' } },
update: { secret: passwordHash, identifier: email },
create: { userId: user.id, provider: 'password', identifier: email, secret: passwordHash },
});

console.log('Dev admin ready:', user.id);
}

main()
.catch((err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1); })
.finally(() => prisma.$disconnect());
Run it locally (never commit it if you’re worried about exposure):
DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD='super-strong' node scripts/create-dev-user.ts
Delete the script afterward or keep it outside the repo (e.g., in a private ops repo).
Step 2 – Login with email/password
Use the standard login flow (e.g., /profile or API POST /api/auth/login).
Because the token now carries role: 'dev', the frontend will redirect you to /dashboard/venue and you’ll have full access.
Step 3 – (Optional) Map your Base wallet
If you want wallet-only auth later:

Use an existing UserWallet table or add one if needed.
Create a script (similar to above) that inserts:
await prisma.userWallet.upsert({
where: { userId_walletId: { userId: user.id, walletId } },
update: {},
create: {
userId: user.id,
wallet: {
connectOrCreate: {
where: { address },
create: { address, chain: 'base' },
},
},
isPrimary: true,
},
});
Introduce a SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) flow that:
Prompts the wallet to sign a nonce.
Verifies the signature server-side.
Looks up wallet.address → user.id.
Issues the same role: 'dev' token when the wallet matches.
Step 4 – Lock down the RBAC pipeline
Server middleware / API endpoint should read the JWT and enforce role checks (don’t rely solely on the client gate).
Only the seed script should ever set someone to dev. If you need to promote someone later, run that script (or a similar one) again.
Rotate credentials periodically and keep the .env values out of git.
Optional “Prompt me” text
If you want to drop instructions into another ChatGPT session:

You are my backend assistant. I need to create a “dev” user with full admin rights in a Prisma/Postgres app. Don’t hard-code secrets. Walk me through a private seed script that:

1. Reads `DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from environment variables.
2. Hashes the password with bcrypt.
3. Upserts a Prisma user with `role = 'dev'`.
4. Upserts the password credential.
5. Optionally links a Base wallet address for SIWE logins.
6. Remind me to delete or secure the script afterwards.

Also show how to enforce server-side RBAC using the token’s role field.
Paste that into GPT when you need a generated script or more detailed CLI steps.

This keeps everything in line with good security practices: no leaked passwords, no doc-based shortcuts, and RBAC enforced by the backend. Once your user is seeded, log in normally and you’ll have the same access as venue/admin for debugging.
