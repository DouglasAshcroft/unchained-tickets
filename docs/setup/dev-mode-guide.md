## localStorage Data Structure

### Purchases Storage

Key: `unchained_purchases`

Format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "charge_1728123456_abc123xyz",
    "eventId": 1,
    "eventTitle": "Metal Fest 2025",
    "tier": "VIP",
    "quantity": 2,
    "totalPrice": 150,
    "transactionId": "charge_1728123456_abc123xyz",
    "purchasedAt": "2025-10-04T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
]
```

### Generated Tickets

Each purchase generates `quantity` tickets:
```javascript
{
  id: "charge_1728123456_abc123xyz-0",
  eventId: 1,
  eventTitle: "Metal Fest 2025",
  eventDate: "2025-11-03T12:34:56.789Z", // 30 days from purchase
  venue: "Local Venue",
  tier: "VIP",
  tokenId: "charge_1728...0",
  qrCode: "TICKET-VIP-1-charge_1728123456_abc123xyz-0",
  status: "active"
}
```

## Production Deployment

When ready to deploy to production:

### 1. Disable Dev Mode
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=false
```

### 2. Set Up Required Keys

See [developerTODO.md](developerTODO.md) for complete checklist:
- Obtain OnchainKit API key from CDP
- Deploy NFT smart contract on Base
- Configure Coinbase Commerce webhooks
- Set up production database
- Configure backend wallet for minting

### 3. Test Production Flow
- Connect wallet with test funds
- Purchase with real USDC on Base testnet
- Verify NFT minting
- Check blockchain transaction

## Troubleshooting

### Tickets Not Showing

**Issue**: Purchased tickets don't appear on My Tickets page

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true` in `.env`
3. Check localStorage in browser DevTools:
   - Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
   - Look for `unchained_purchases` key
4. Restart dev server after changing `.env`

### Payment Button Not Working

**Issue**: "Simulate Payment" button does nothing

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify dev server is running
3. Check that `/api/checkout/create-charge` endpoint is accessible
4. Try clearing localStorage and retry

### Wrong Payment UI Showing

**Issue**: Seeing OnchainKit button instead of "Simulate Payment"

**Solution**:
1. Verify `.env` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true`
2. Restart dev server (Next.js caches env variables)
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

   - "We can choose between General Admission and VIP"

3. **Configure Purchase**

   - "Total is $150 USDC on Base blockchain"

4. **Simulate Payment**
   - "In dev mode, we can simulate the payment"
   - "This would normally connect your Coinbase wallet"
   - "Processing... and success!"

5. **Show Tickets**
   - "Now I can view my NFT tickets"
   - "Each ticket has a unique QR code"
   - "At the venue, staff scan this to verify and admit"
