# Clean Up & Polish - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully completed Option A: Clean up and polish the Unchained Tickets application. All errors fixed, dev mode fully functional, and application ready for testing and demos.

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Resolution Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/viem.js'`

**Root Cause:** Stale Next.js build cache from previous builds

**Solution:**
- Cleared `.next` build directory
- Killed existing Next.js processes
- Rebuilt with clean cache

**Files Modified:** None (cache cleanup)

---

### 2. Missing Favicon Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/server/app/favicon.ico/route.js'`

**Root Cause:** Build cache trying to find route that doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Verified `app/favicon.ico` exists (25.9 KB)
- Cleared build cache resolved the issue
- Favicon properly served after rebuild

**Files Modified:** None (existing favicon confirmed)

---

### 3. Broken Unsplash Image URLs ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `upstream image response failed for https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1464375117522... 404`

**Root Cause:** Unsplash photo ID no longer available/moved

**Solution:**
- Updated event poster image URLs in seed data
- Changed from: `photo-1464375117522-1311d275e1b0`
- Changed to: `photo-1470229722913-7c0e2dbbafd3`
- New URL: Working Unsplash concert/event image

**Files Modified:**
- [prisma/seed.ts](prisma/seed.ts:169) - Updated posterImageUrl

## Known Limitations (By Design)

### Development Mode Limitations

1. **No Real Blockchain Integration**
   - Tickets stored in localStorage (not blockchain)
   - No NFT minting
   - No wallet connection required
   - Perfect for testing, not production

2. **Mock Data**
   - Transaction IDs are simulated
   - Event dates are placeholder
   - Venue info is simplified
   - Replace with real data for production

3. **No Payment Processing**
   - Simulated 2-second delay
   - Always successful (no error handling demo)
   - No actual USDC transfer
   - Switch to production mode for real payments

---

## Production Checklist
