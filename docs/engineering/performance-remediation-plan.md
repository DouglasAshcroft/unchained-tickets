stop

Got it. I’ll pause here—just let me know when you want to pick things back up.

I only want you to use the project unchained-tickets, the project Unchained is an old project that was migrated.

Understood—you want me to stick strictly to the unchained-tickets project and ignore the older Unchained directory. I'll work only within unchained-tickets going forward.

Root Causes

Lighthouse reports an 8 MB initial payload and 3.5 MB JS bundle on the landing page, with 890 ms TBT and several 300 – 400 ms main‑thread tasks (Lighthouse.md:186-238). The biggest culprits are app/page.js, app/layout.js, and the OnchainKit wallet chunk—these are shipping to every route.
RootProvider is a client component that wraps the whole app with Wagmi, React Query, and @coinbase/onchainkit (app/rootProvider.tsx:1-53), forcing the entire tree to hydrate and pulling in wallet dependencies even for unauthenticated readers.
Navbar is also client-only and imports ConnectWallet, Wagmi, and the custom auth store (components/layout/Navbar.tsx:1-159), so every page pays for wallet UI, Zustand, and OnchainKit styles even if the user never connects a wallet.
Event listing is fully client rendered: app/events/page.tsx:1-200 pulls in React Query, date-fns, and use-debounce, then fetches /api/events after hydration. That means a blank shell until JS loads, plus extra bundle weight from those libraries.
The events API returns much more than the list needs (all artist links and nested artist objects, lib/repositories/EventRepository.ts:36-83). That bloats the JSON payload React Query has to pull across the wire on every page visit/search.
Event detail repeats the pattern: it’s a client component using React Query (app/events/[id]/page.tsx:1-200), eagerly imports CheckoutModal, and that modal immediately loads the full OnchainKit checkout flow (components/CheckoutModal.tsx:1-210). Users must download the checkout SDK before they even scroll.
There are two separate QueryClientProviders (app/rootProvider.tsx:24-52 and app/providers.tsx:14-43). Besides duplicated setup cost, that keeps the whole app locked in client mode.
Optimization Plan

Instrument: capture a fresh Lighthouse run on / and /events after npm run build; add ANALYZE=true npm run build to confirm which chunks dominate. Track baseline LCP/TBT/JS size so you can prove improvement.
Restructure global providers: keep the server layout lean, then dynamically load a lightweight WalletProvider only where wallet actions are needed. The base layout should stay server-rendered; move the Theme toggler into a small client island and drop the duplicate QueryClient layer.
Split the navbar: render the static links server-side, and lazy-load a WalletControls client island that wraps Wagmi/ConnectWallet. That removes OnchainKit and Zustand from the default bundle.
Rebuild /events as a server component that fetches with await eventService.getEvents() (or a server action) and streams results. Keep a tiny client component for the search box; debounce via server search or a lightweight helper instead of React Query/date-fns in the main bundle.
Tighten the events query: for the list, return only the fields EventCard uses (id, title, startsAt, venue summary, poster URL). Add Prisma selects to drop supporting artists and heavy relations, and set a sensible revalidate window or cache layer for mostly static listings.
Rework /events/[id]: load the event data server-side, split the purchase widget into a dynamic(() => import('@/components/CheckoutModal'), { ssr: false }), and only hydrate wallet code when the user opens the modal. Offer a light server-rendered overview so the page is usable before JS.
Clean up assets: audit /public posters and fonts to ensure they’re optimized, remove unused preconnect hints (Lighthouse.md:54-69), and rely on next/font where possible.
After each change, rerun Lighthouse/web vitals and record bundle output; keep a running table in Lighthouse.md or a dedicated perf log so regressions are obvious.
Next steps: 1) confirm a bundle-analysis baseline, 2) peel wallet/providers out of the global layout, 3) convert /events to server rendering and trim its API payload, verifying Lighthouse after each stage.

The wallet acts as the user profile and login per Base app's docs, otherwise lets proceed with fixing the performance and SEO issues.

Key Changes

app/rootProvider.tsx:12 + app/providers.tsx:13 now keep only the Wagmi + React Query providers at the app shell, dropping the global OnchainKit layer so shared hydration is lighter while wallet auth still works.
components/layout/Navbar.tsx:10, components/layout/WalletControls.tsx:17, and components/CheckoutModal.tsx:6 lazy-load all wallet UI; OnchainKit initializes only inside the navbar controls or checkout modal, shrinking the default client bundle without sacrificing login.
app/events/page.tsx:33 together with app/events/EventsBrowser.tsx:56 move the events listing to a server rendered payload with a slim client browser (no React Query, no date-fns/use-debounce), keeping search/filter UX but cutting shipped JS.
app/events/[id]/page.tsx:16 and app/events/[id]/PurchasePanel.tsx:20 render event details on the server and defer checkout logic to a small client island that loads the modal on demand, reducing initial work on the heavy event page.
lib/repositories/EventRepository.ts:36, app/layout.tsx:39, app/page.tsx:29, and public/robots.txt trim the events API payload, remove unused font preconnects, provide descriptive hero link text, and add a valid robots.txt to clear Lighthouse SEO warnings.
Testing

npm run lint
Next Steps

Re-run Lighthouse (desktop + mobile) on / and /events to confirm bundle/TBT improvements and catch any remaining regressions.
Validate wallet login and checkout flows end-to-end after the lazy-loading changes; keep an eye on console for missing provider warnings.
Consider a follow-up ANALYZE=true npm run build to quantify the bundle shrink and prioritize any remaining large chunks (e.g., event wizard).

What changed

app/events/page.tsx:9 now wraps the Prisma call so if Postgres isn’t running we fall back to an empty list and surface “Events are temporarily unavailable” instead of throwing a runtime error.
app/events/EventsBrowser.tsx:24 accepts an initialError; the component keeps that message visible until a successful fetch clears it, so the UI explains why nothing is loading even when the DB is offline.
Status

npm run lint
Now when the database at localhost:5433 is down you’ll still land on /events with a clear error banner instead of a crash. Restart the DB when you’re ready and the page will populate normally.

Wallet Chunk Deferred

components/layout/WalletControls.tsx:1 now renders a lightweight button by default and only loads the heavy OnchainKit bundle the first time a user connects or when Wagmi reports an already-connected wallet.
components/layout/WalletPanel.tsx:1 holds the actual OnchainKit provider/menu logic so it’s split into its own chunk and fetched strictly on demand.
components/layout/Navbar.tsx:3 imports the new lazy controls directly, so the navigation no longer triggers the 3.5 MB wallet chunk during the initial render.
With the wallet UI no longer shipping up front, that \_app-pages-browser_components_layout_WalletControls… asset should drop out of Lighthouse’s “unused JavaScript” and “enormous payload” findings. Re-run Lighthouse after restarting the dev server to verify the scores, and then spot-check the wallet/auth flows (desktop + mobile menu) to ensure the deferred load still feels smooth.

If the preload warning on app/layout.css persists, it’s coming from Next’s built-in CSS preloading; once bundle sizes are back in check you can revisit with a production build to see whether it still fires.

ok lets address the rest of the list 2. Client Bundle & Hydration
Audit imports for large libraries only needed server-side (e.g., date-fns, Fuse.js). Lazy-load or move into server components where possible.
Replace @tanstack/react-query usage that only fetches once with server actions or fetch in the route’s server component to avoid hydrating unused caches.
Convert heavy client components (wizard steps, dashboard cards) into server components with minimal client islands.
Use Next Image for posters, ensure icons/logos aren’t loading full-resolution files. 3. API & Database
Profile the Prisma queries used in VenueDashboardService and event listing routes:
Ensure indexes exist for date/status filters.
Limit include to only the fields used (e.g., reduce ticket payload for summary views).
Use caching (revalidate headers or Vercel KV/Redis) for dashboard stats that don’t change per second.
Batch dependent calls. Instead of multiple parallel Prisma queries, fetch aggregated data in a single query when feasible. 4. React Query & Global State
Drop React Query for simple one-time fetches; it adds overhead without caching benefits.
Ensure any useEffect polling or setInterval loops are paused when unnecessary.
Double-check the auth store (useAuth) isn’t doing redundant network calls on every render. 5. Images, Fonts, Assets
Audit the /public images referenced in cards; large hero images without proper sizing/formatting cause big payloads.
Prefetch fonts via next/font to reduce layout shifts and blocking.
Ensure poster previews use appropriately scaled Image components with width/height provided. 6. UX-level Improvements
Implement skeleton loaders for the wizard and dashboard so perceived speed improves even before all data arrives.
Defer non-critical modules (e.g., analytics, chat widgets) with dynamic imports ({ ssr: false }) so they don’t block the main render. 7. Track & Regress
Set up Web Vitals logging (next/head or reportWebVitals) to track TTFB, FCP, LCP over time.
Document a baseline: response time, render time, bundle sizes, and revisit after each optimization.

Performance Updates

Converted venues and artists listings into server-rendered shells with lean client islands (app/venues/page.tsx, app/venues/VenuesBrowser.tsx, app/artists/page.tsx, app/artists/ArtistsBrowser.tsx) so we ship static data, filter locally, and avoid React Query/use-debounce on read-only pages.
Rebuilt venue/artist detail routes as server components (app/venues/[slug]/page.tsx, app/artists/[slug]/page.tsx) so they stream fully rendered content without a client-side fetch-and-hydrate tax.
Slimmed the global search widget (components/SearchBar.tsx) by dropping React Query, Fuse.js, and use-debounce in favor of a tiny debounced fetch with AbortController.
Deferred the heavy OnchainKit bundle behind an explicit user action (components/layout/WalletControls.tsx, new WalletPanel.tsx, components/layout/Navbar.tsx), keeping wallet login while removing the 3.5 MB preload from default navigation.
Tightened Prisma payloads for venue/artist lists (lib/repositories/VenueRepository.ts, lib/repositories/ArtistRepository.ts) and remapped their event counts server-side (lib/services/EventService.ts) so list APIs return just the fields the UI needs.
Quality Checks

npm run lint
Next Steps

Re-run Lighthouse on /, /events, /venues, and /artists to confirm the wallet chunk and unused JS warnings disappear and capture the new baseline.
Remove the now-unused use-debounce (and Fuse.js if nothing else references it) from package.json/lockfile to keep dependencies tidy.
Continue on the remaining checklist: image/font audits, dashboard skeletons, caching for dashboard metrics, and web-vitals logging once the bundle stabilizes.

Here’s how I’d tackle the regression, broken into tight chunks so we can validate as we go. Nothing needs a wholesale revert; each issue can be corrected in-place.

1. Checkout modal import (runtime crash in PurchasePanel)

Update the dynamic import in app/events/[id]/PurchasePanel.tsx#25 to resolve the named export:
dynamic(() => import('@/components/CheckoutModal').then((mod) => mod.CheckoutModal), { ssr: false });
Retest /events/[id] to confirm the modal renders without the “promise” element-type error. 2. Prisma select fields that don’t exist

Adjust lib/repositories/VenueRepository.ts#24 to select only columns the schema actually exposes (drop description, keep id/name/slug/city/state/capacity/addressLine1/addressLine2/postalCode, etc.).
Do the same for lib/repositories/ArtistRepository.ts#20, mirroring the schema (no bio/website columns).
In lib/services/EventService.ts#116, map \_count.events accordingly. 3. Await Next.js streaming parameters

In app/events/page.tsx#31, app/events/[id]/page.tsx#16, and any other server components using params/searchParams, destructure them as const { searchParams } = await props; before accessing properties.
Re-run the routes to clear the “should be awaited” warnings. 4. Verify the new server-side browsers still behave

After fixes above, smoke-test /venues, /artists, and /events to ensure lists render, filters work, and there are no Prisma errors in dev tools. 5. Optional but quick follow-ups

Add the remote image host (www.etsy.com) to next.config.js images.remotePatterns so poster previews don't 403.
Run npm run lint && npm run typecheck (or prisma generate if schema types changed) once edits land.
Let me know once you’re ready to start implementing these, or if you’d prefer to back out the earlier refactor instead.

Delete this path and mock a new image Add the remote image host (www.etsy.com) to next.config.js images.remotePatterns so poster previews don't 403. then lets start from the top

Swapped the checkout modal’s dynamic import in app/events/[id]/PurchasePanel.tsx so it resolves to CheckoutModal, eliminating the “promise element” runtime crash.
Added a shared sanitizer (lib/utils/posterImage.ts) and applied it throughout the stack (lib/services/EventService.ts, components/EventCard.tsx, app/events/[id]/page.tsx, metadata API) so any poster URL that’s missing, malformed, or from www.etsy.com now falls back to /assets/textures/resistance-poster.jpg.
Updated the metadata route to serve the sanitized poster, keeping NFT metadata consistent with the new fallback.
Explicitly whitelisted www.etsy.com in next.config.ts image remote patterns per your request.
npm run lint passes.

Next, we can revisit the remaining regressions (Prisma select fields, awaited params, etc.) once you’re ready to continue.

do not whitelist etsy, delete that. Then lets continue

Updates made:

Removed the temporary Etsy whitelist from next.config.ts; we’ll rely on our own fallback imagery instead of allowing that remote host.
Centralized poster handling with sanitizePosterImageUrl (lib/utils/posterImage.ts) and wired it through the API/service layers, event cards, metadata route, and event detail page so every poster URL is validated and falls back to /assets/textures/resistance-poster.jpg when missing or unsafe.
Fixed the checkout modal import (app/events/[id]/PurchasePanel.tsx) so the dynamic load returns the CheckoutModal component, avoiding the lazy-element runtime crash.
Cleaned up Prisma queries to request only schema-backed fields (lib/repositories/VenueRepository.ts, lib/repositories/ArtistRepository.ts) and adjusted the server-rendered venues/artists pages plus their client browsers to match the slimmer payloads.
Adapted all app-router pages to await params/searchParams per Next 15 requirements, removing the console warnings.
Trimmed list/browser types so we’re no longer referencing columns that don’t exist, but the UI behavior (search, filter, sorting) stays intact.
npm run lint passes.

Next thoughts:

Smoke-test /events, /venues, /artists, and /events/[id] to confirm the fallback poster renders, no Prisma validation errors pop up, and navigation works without warnings.
With the data layer stabilized, we can move on to the remaining perf checklist (e.g., VenueDashboardService query slimming, hydration islands, skeleton loaders, Web Vitals logging) whenever you’re ready.

restore the payment model to be a popup in an industry standand method. Do not do custom fixes that change the funtionality and UI/UX that I have spent a lot of time getting it to work the way I want it. Also since we are fixing the check out model now, Lets add a method for standard CC/Debit card payments as well.

Here’s a tight plan so we can restore the familiar modal experience and add card payments without derailing the existing UX:

1. Capture the prior modal baseline

Compare the current components/CheckoutModal.tsx and app/events/[id]/PurchasePanel.tsx against the previous commits to confirm the exact UI/behavior you’d already dialed in.
If the earlier version used tabs or a prebuilt layout, we’ll restore that structure.
Verify any styling helpers or shared components it depended on. 2. Rebuild the popup shell

Recreate the original modal markup (header, order summary, footer actions) so it matches the prior look/feel.
Ensure the open/close handling in PurchasePanel mirrors the earlier flow (e.g., transitions, overlay click behavior). 3. Split payment methods into standard tabs/options

Inside the modal, add a “Crypto Wallet” section that wires to the existing Coinbase/OnchainKit flow exactly as before.
Introduce a clear second option (“Credit / Debit Card”) with a tab or toggle—matching the styling you used elsewhere. 4. Implement the card checkout pathway

Add a card form backed by your preferred processor (Stripe Payment Element or a lightweight custom form that posts to /api/checkout/card-charge).
Create supporting API route(s) (e.g., /api/checkout/create-card-payment) to talk to Stripe/your gateway.
Show standard validation, error states, and success handling; reuse the onSuccess callback so tickets flow the same after payment.
Gate this behind environment checks so local dev can use a mock/sandbox key. 5. Reconcile shared logic

Factor the shared order summary/receipt builder into a helper so both payment methods stay in sync.
Ensure dev-mode mocks still work (e.g., keep the “mock mint” button for on-chain testing, add a card sandbox option). 6. Regression tests

Manual pass on /events/[id]: open modal, switch between wallet and card, confirm the UI matches the “industry standard” look you had, and ensure both flows close the modal on success.
Run npm run lint and any relevant integration tests.
Once you’re happy with the plan (or if there’s a specific gateway you want for cards), I can jump into implementation step by step.

The credit card will need to also mint an NFT, I believe we can use Base's paymaster to handle that transaction.

Here’s how I’d tackle it so the card flow can mint just like the wallet path, while piggybacking on Base’s Paymaster for gasless minting:

1. Restore & reuse the modal shell

Bring back the prior two-pane modal: tabs for “Crypto Wallet” (Coinbase) and “Credit / Debit Card.”
Keep your existing styling/layout so the popup feels exactly like the version you’d already honed. 2. Split payment responsibilities cleanly

Crypto tab keeps using OnchainKit as it does now.
Card tab fires a Stripe (or other PSP) Payment Element flow—collect card details, confirm the payment client-side, then hand off a paymentIntent id to our backend. 3. Backend orchestration for the card path

New API route (e.g., POST /api/checkout/card-charge) that:
Verifies the card payment succeeded with the PSP.
Requests a sponsorship from Base’s Paymaster.
Calls the NFT mint server-side with that Paymaster sponsorship so the user isn’t paying gas.
Records the ticket + receipt just like the wallet path.
Returns a transaction id to the UI. 4. Minting detail

Reuse the contract mint helper you already have for the wallet flow.
When minting for a card purchaser, build and sign the transaction on the server, attach the Paymaster’s sponsorship (per the Base docs), submit it, and wait for confirmation before returning success. 5. Update the modal UX

On the card tab, show the card form + short “minting on Base” explainer so the user knows they’ll still receive an NFT.
When the form submits: show a single spinner while the API route charges, sponsors gas, and mints; on success, call the existing onSuccess callback so the modal closes and the UI updates. 6. Testing pass

Happy path: card payment → mint → success toast → redirect to “My Tickets.”
Failure handling: payment fails, paymaster sponsorship rejected, mint revert. Surface clean errors and let the user retry.
Regression: wallet tab unchanged; mock dev mode still works.
Once you’re ready to flip the env back to write mode, we can implement each slice step-by-step.

What options do we have with Base to impliment a self costoidal wallet when the user pays with card that will house the NFT?

For card buyers you essentially need a “wallet-as-a-service” layer that spins up a self‑custodial smart wallet on Base, so the NFT can be minted to an address the user actually controls. Within the Base ecosystem these are the main routes teams take today:

Coinbase Smart Wallet + OnchainKit – OnchainKit can create a passkey- or OAuth-backed smart wallet for any user (no extension, no seed phrase) and Base’s paymaster can sponsor gas for the first mint. Flow: start the smart-wallet onboarding as soon as the user begins checkout, take the card payment, then mint to that smart wallet using a paymaster sponsorship.

Privy (Base integration) – Privy embeds passkey/biometric wallets that are truly user-controlled. Their SDK also lets you charge cards (Stripe) and run Base-sponsored transactions, so you can accept the fiat payment and mint to the Privy wallet immediately afterward.

Third-party embedded wallets (Dynamic, Magic, thirdweb Embedded Wallets, Crossmint) – each of these services supports Base, issues a self-custodial smart wallet tied to email/social login, and can either handle the fiat checkout themselves (Crossmint, Paper) or let you hook up Stripe. After the card charge they expose the user’s smart wallet address so you can mint with a paymaster.

DIY AA wallet + paymaster – You can stand up your own account-abstraction smart wallet factory (e.g., Stackup/Alchemy AA SDK) to deploy a smart wallet per user, store the passkey in the browser, and fund the mint with Base’s open USD paymaster. This gives the most control, but you’re responsible for the entire UX.

Each option keeps the wallet self-custodial (user owns the keys, typically via passkey or biometrics) while still letting you charge a card and mint the NFT automatically. Which one you choose mostly depends on how much of the onboarding UX you want to own versus offload.

Lets stick with Base's intergration and begin building the checkout process

Added tabbed payment selection inside components/CheckoutModal.tsx, keeping the original Coinbase wallet experience intact while introducing a “Credit / Debit Card” option with the same modal layout you’d already designed.
Built components/CardCheckoutForm.tsx, a card checkout scaffold that collects payer info, calls a new backend endpoint, and reminds future implementers where to drop in the Stripe/Coinbase Pay element.
Created the server-side plumbing: app/api/checkout/card-charge/route.ts now receives card purchases, validates input, logs the simulated charge, and hands off to lib/services/PaymasterService.ts’s mintTicketsWithPaymaster stub (ready for the actual Base Paymaster integration).
Exposed the mint helper for card flows with mintTicketsWithPaymaster so we can plug in Base’s paymaster + smart wallet sponsorship once the PSP hook is in place.
npm run lint

Next steps:

Swap the placeholder card form with your chosen PSP (Stripe Payment Element, Coinbase Pay, etc.) so you can capture a real payment token.
Wire mintTicketsWithPaymaster to your contract mint helper and Base paymaster SDK, returning the real transaction hash.
Update the card flow to hydrate/create the per-user smart wallet (e.g., OnchainKit smart wallet) and send its address in the request so minted tickets land in the correct custody.

We will use Coinbase pay, lets begin

Added a Coinbase Pay flow to the “Card” tab by swapping the old manual form for an OnchainKit Buy component (components/CardCheckoutForm.tsx). It now fetches a session token, guides the user through the Coinbase Pay onramp, and, after success, calls our minting endpoint while showing clear status/error feedback.
Stubbed the Coinbase Pay session API (app/api/coinbase-pay/session/route.ts) so the UI can request a session token—ready to be replaced with the real Coinbase Pay Sessions call when credentials are wired up.
Expanded the card checkout backend (app/api/checkout/card-charge/route.ts) and the mint helper (lib/services/PaymasterService.ts) to accept Coinbase Pay–specific fields (wallet address, transaction reference) and mint after the fiat onramp.
Kept the existing wallet checkout intact and left the paymaster minting logic stubbed (mintTicketsWithPaymaster) so you can plug in the actual Base Paymaster SDK next.
npm run lint

Next steps:

Replace the session stub with Coinbase Pay’s real session API (store API key/secret, pass back the session_token).
Hook mintTicketsWithPaymaster to your smart-wallet mint contract using Base’s paymaster sponsorship so the fiat flow finishes the NFT mint.
Confirm that the Coinbase Pay session respects the connected wallet (OnchainKit smart wallet) and that the Buy component returns a transaction receipt you can persist/log for audits.

walk me throught the next steps, what actions do I need to take, explain them clearly.

Here’s what’s left to turn the scaffolding into a live Coinbase Pay + Base paymaster flow:

Hook up a real Coinbase Pay session token

Create API credentials in Coinbase Commerce (OnchainKit docs walk through it).
In app/api/coinbase-pay/session/route.ts, replace the random UUID with a call to Coinbase’s Sessions API (POST /v1/buys/sessions). Pass the buyer’s wallet address, desired asset (USDC on Base), and your redirect URLs.
Return Coinbase’s session_token to the client. You may want to cache it server-side for reconciliation later.
Mint via Base Paymaster after the card onramp succeeds

In /api/checkout/card-charge, replace the TODO log with real logic:
Confirm the card onramp by verifying the transactionReference (Coinbase Pay webhooks can help).
Use your mint helper (or Base’s AA SDK) to build the NFT mint transaction, request a paymaster sponsorship, submit it, and wait for a receipt.
Return the resulting transaction hash (that becomes the transactionId you show in the UI).
The placeholder mintTicketsWithPaymaster in lib/services/PaymasterService.ts is the hook for this code.
Ensure the connected wallet is self-custodial and ready before checkout

OnchainKit can create a Smart Wallet when the user lands on the page; make sure that wallet address is what you send to Coinbase Pay.
If a user isn’t connected, prompt them to spin up the smart wallet before the card flow starts; otherwise minting can’t land anywhere.
Handle success/failure signals

The Buy component calls onSuccess with a transaction receipt. Use that to trigger the mint and to record a receipt for bookkeeping.
Handle onError to show clear messages if Coinbase Pay drops or if minting fails.
Testing and run-through

Try the full flow in Base Sepolia: connect a test smart wallet, run Coinbase Pay with a sandbox card, confirm the session, see the mint happen, and verify the NFT appears in the smart wallet.
Simulate payment/mint errors to ensure the UI surfaces them and lets the user retry without losing their place.
Once those pieces are wired in, the card checkout path will mirror the wallet path: seamless fiat onramp, gasless mint, same modal experience.

I have my commerce API walk me through this step in detail

Hook up a real Coinbase Pay session token

Create API credentials in Coinbase Commerce (OnchainKit docs walk through it).
In app/api/coinbase-pay/session/route.ts, replace the random UUID with a call to Coinbase’s Sessions API (POST /v1/buys/sessions). Pass the buyer’s wallet address, desired asset (USDC on Base), and your redirect URLs.
Return Coinbase’s session_token to the client. You may want to cache it server-side for reconciliation later.

Here’s how to turn that stubbed session endpoint into a real Coinbase Pay session creator, step by step:

1. Generate Coinbase Pay API credentials
   Log into your Coinbase Commerce (or Coinbase Developer) dashboard.
   Go to Settings → API Keys and create a key that has “Buy with Coinbase” (Coinbase Pay) permissions.
   You’ll get an API key (sometimes also a secret). Copy it immediately; you can’t view it again.
2. Store the key (and URLs) in env vars
   Edit your Next.js environment file—e.g. .env.local for local dev—and add:

COINBASE_PAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: override if Coinbase gives you a different base URL

COINBASE_PAY_API_URL=https://api.coinbase.com/v3/buy/sessions
COINBASE_PAY_SUCCESS_URL=https://your-app.com/checkout/success
COINBASE_PAY_CANCEL_URL=https://your-app.com/checkout/cancel
Restart npm run dev after updating the file so the new values load.

3. Update app/api/coinbase-pay/session/route.ts
   Replace the random UUID logic with a real fetch call to Coinbase:

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const COINBASE_PAY_API_URL =
process.env.COINBASE_PAY_API_URL ?? 'https://api.coinbase.com/v3/buy/sessions';
const COINBASE_PAY_API_KEY = process.env.COINBASE_PAY_API_KEY;
const SUCCESS_URL =
process.env.COINBASE_PAY_SUCCESS_URL ?? `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/checkout/success`;
const CANCEL_URL =
process.env.COINBASE_PAY_CANCEL_URL ?? `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/checkout/cancel`;

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
try {
const body = await request.json().catch(() => ({}));
const { walletAddress, eventId, quantity, totalPrice } = body ?? {};

    if (!walletAddress || typeof walletAddress !== 'string') {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'walletAddress is required before launching Coinbase Pay.' },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    if (typeof eventId !== 'number') {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'eventId is required.' }, { status: 400 });
    }

    if (!COINBASE_PAY_API_KEY) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Coinbase Pay API key not configured on server.' },
        { status: 500 }
      );
    }

    // Payload fields follow Coinbase’s session API spec.
    const payload = {
      partner_user_id: walletAddress, // Unique identifier on your side
      wallet_address: walletAddress,
      destination_wallet: {
        address: walletAddress,
        blockchains: [
          {
            blockchain: 'base', // or 'base-sepolia' if you’re testing
          },
        ],
      },
      asset: 'USDC',
      amount: {
        amount: totalPrice?.toString() ?? undefined,
        currency: 'USD',
      },
      extra_params: {
        event_id: eventId,
        quantity,
      },
      redirect_url: SUCCESS_URL,
      cancel_url: CANCEL_URL,
    };

    const response = await fetch(COINBASE_PAY_API_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${COINBASE_PAY_API_KEY}`,
        'CB-VERSION': '2023-08-23', // use the date Coinbase specifies in their docs
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorPayload = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
      console.error('Coinbase Pay session error', errorPayload);
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: errorPayload?.error ?? 'Unable to create Coinbase Pay session.' },
        { status: response.status }
      );
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    // Coinbase’s response shape includes session_token; adjust if their schema changes.
    return NextResponse.json({ sessionToken: data.session_token });

} catch (error) {
console.error('Error creating Coinbase Pay session', error);
return NextResponse.json(
{ error: 'Failed to create Coinbase Pay session.' },
{ status: 500 }
);
}
}
Key points:

Authorization: Bearer <API key> authenticates the call (adjust headers if Coinbase requires a different scheme).
CB-VERSION ensures you’re hitting the version Coinbase expects.
The payload should include the destination wallet address, asset (USDC on Base), amount, and your own metadata (event id, quantity, etc.).
Parse the JSON and return the session_token to the client. Save it to your database if you want to reconcile onramp activity later. 4. Test end-to-end in a sandbox
Run the app and open the checkout modal’s “Credit / Debit Card” tab.
Watch the network tab—you should see POST /api/coinbase-pay/session yielding a real session token.
Coinbase Pay should open with USDC on Base, using your redirect URLs.
After completing the fiat flow, verify your /api/checkout/card-charge endpoint receives the transactionReference and mints the NFT via Base Paymaster.
Once that’s working in Base Sepolia, you can flip the config to production and start accepting live card-to-NFT purchases.

This is what I found in base docs at the Commerce API, what stub out the correct implimentation in the example env file so I know how I should impliment this with the current code base.

-d '{

      "name": "The Human Fund",

      "description": "Money For People",

      "pricing_type": "fixed_price",

      "local_price": {

        "amount": "1.00",

        "currency": "USD"

      }

    }'

​

Step 4: Retrieve a Charge

Retrieve the charge to get payment information. The id field in the response is the CHARGE_UUID.

Example:
