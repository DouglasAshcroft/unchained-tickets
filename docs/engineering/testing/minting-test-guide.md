## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Cause:** Minting wallet ran out of testnet ETH

**Fix:**
1. Check minting wallet balance: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x5B33aA418a6d455AADc391841788e8F72Df5ECd9
2. Use faucet to add more: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet
3. Retry purchase

### "Wallet not connected"
**Cause:** Coinbase Wallet extension not connected

**Fix:**
1. Click "Connect Wallet" in navbar
2. Select Coinbase Wallet
3. Approve connection
4. Retry purchase

### "Contract not found" or "Contract call error"
**Cause:** NFT contract may not be deployed or address is wrong

**Fix:**
1. Verify contract address in `.env`: `NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
2. Check contract on BaseScan: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
3. Ensure contract is verified and deployed

### Transaction Takes Forever
**Cause:** Network congestion or RPC issues

**Fix:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes
2. Check Base Sepolia network status
3. If timeout, retry the purchase

## Gas Costs

- **Per mint**: ~0.0001-0.0005 ETH (~$0.30-$1.50 on mainnet)
- **Testnet**: Free (uses testnet ETH)
- **Who pays**: Minting wallet (`0x5B33...ECd9`)
- **Who receives**: Your connected wallet

## Next Steps After Testing

Once minting works:
1. Test with multiple tickets (quantity > 1)
2. Test with different tiers (GA vs VIP)
3. Verify ticket status updates in database
4. Check NFT metadata shows correct event info
5. Test transfer restrictions (if implemented)

---

## Production Considerations

Before going live:
- [ ] Deploy new smart contract to Base mainnet
- [ ] Generate new minting wallet (don't use testnet wallet)
- [ ] Fund minting wallet with real ETH (~0.1 ETH = $300)
- [ ] Update contract address in `.env`
- [ ] Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` to `8453` (Base mainnet)
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=false`
- [ ] Test with small amounts first
