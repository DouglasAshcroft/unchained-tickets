# Base Mainnet Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through deploying the UnchainedTickets smart contract to Base Mainnet for production use.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This deployment uses **REAL ETH** and cannot be undone. Follow all steps carefully.

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Successfully deployed and tested contract on Base Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Tested complete flow (event creation, purchases, minting) on testnet
- [ ] Generated new mainnet minting wallet (separate from testnet)
- [ ] Access to wallet with 0.05-0.1 ETH on Base Mainnet for deployment
- [ ] BaseScan API key for contract verification
- [ ] Vercel account with project configured
- [ ] Read and understood [VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md](./VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md)

---

## Security: Wallet Separation

**‚ùå DO NOT** reuse your testnet wallet for mainnet!

| Wallet Type | Network | Use Case | Security Level |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Testnet Wallet** | Base Sepolia | Testing, development | Lower (shareable) |
| **Mainnet Minting Wallet** | Base Mainnet | Minting NFTs in production | High (secure storage) |
| **Mainnet Deployer Wallet** | Base Mainnet | Deploying contract | High (can be same as minting) |

**Your Wallet Addresses:**

```bash
# Testnet (Base Sepolia) - Preview/Development
Testnet Minting Wallet: 0x5B33aA418a6d455AADc391841788e8F72Df5ECd9

# Mainnet (Base) - Production
Mainnet Minting Wallet: 0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
```

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Generate Mainnet Minting Wallet (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

You've already generated a new secure wallet:

**Address:** `0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0`

**Private Key:** `0xd34c899e81238a09e2adc43bc922ab8a81d00e281793497ef0bc73c43c2e1205`

**Mnemonic:** `sting cargo direct venture brush oyster cotton tower exact sibling foil throw`

**Security Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Save private key to password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
2. ‚úÖ Save mnemonic phrase to secure backup (separate from private key)
3. ‚úÖ Label as "Unchained Tickets Mainnet Minting Wallet"
4. ‚è≥ Add to Vercel (will do in Step 6)

---

### Step 2: Fund Mainnet Wallets

You need TWO funded wallets:

#### 2a. Fund Deployer Wallet (for contract deployment)

**Amount needed:** 0.05-0.1 ETH on Base Mainnet

**Options:**

**Option A: Use your existing wallet**
- If you already have a wallet with ETH on Base Mainnet, you can use that
- Make sure the private key is in your `.env` file as `MINTING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (we'll update hardhat config to use separate deployer key)

**Option B: Bridge ETH to Base**
1. Go to https://bridge.base.org/
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet
3. Bridge 0.1 ETH from Ethereum to Base Mainnet
4. Wait for confirmation (~5 minutes)
5. Add wallet private key to `.env` as `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`

**Option C: Buy ETH directly on Base**
1. Use Coinbase or other exchange
2. Select Base network when withdrawing
3. Send to your deployer address

#### 2b. Fund Minting Wallet (for ongoing minting operations)

**Address:** `0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0`

**Amount needed:** 0.05 ETH on Base Mainnet

**What this covers:**
- ~100 NFT mints: 0.03 ETH
- Gas price spikes buffer: 0.01 ETH
- Granting MINTER_ROLE: 0.001 ETH
- Reserve: 0.009 ETH

**How to fund:**
1. Send **0.05 ETH** to `0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0`
2. **CRITICAL:** Select **Base Mainnet** network (chain ID 8453)
3. **NOT Ethereum mainnet!**
4. Verify transaction: https://basescan.org/address/0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check minting wallet balance
node scripts/generate-mainnet-wallet.mjs
# Or manually check: https://basescan.org/address/0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
```

---

### Step 3: Update Hardhat Configuration

We need to separate the deployer wallet from the minting wallet.

**Option A:** Update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add deployer wallet (for contract deployment)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_DEPLOYER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Keep minting wallet separate (for MINTER_ROLE)
MAINNET_MINTING_PRIVATE_KEY=0xd34c899e81238a09e2adc43bc922ab8a81d00e281793497ef0bc73c43c2e1205
MAINNET_MINTING_ADDRESS=0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
```

**Option B:** Use same wallet for both (simpler):

```bash
# Use same wallet for deployment and minting
MINTING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xd34c899e81238a09e2adc43bc922ab8a81d00e281793497ef0bc73c43c2e1205
MINTING_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
```

**Recommended:** Option B (same wallet) for simplicity. Fund the minting wallet with 0.1 ETH to cover both deployment and minting.

---

### Step 4: Deploy Contract to Base Mainnet

**Pre-deployment checklist:**
- [ ] Minting wallet funded with ‚â•0.1 ETH on Base Mainnet
- [ ] `MINTING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` set in `.env`
- [ ] `BASESCAN_API_KEY` set in `.env`
- [ ] Contract tested successfully on testnet
- [ ] Terminal clear (no other processes running)

**Run deployment:**

```bash
# Deploy to Base Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/deploy-mainnet.cjs --network baseMainnet
```

**What this does:**
1. Checks your wallet balance (minimum 0.05 ETH)
2. Asks for confirmation (type "DEPLOY" to continue)
3. Deploys UnchainedTickets contract
4. Waits for 5 block confirmations
5. Verifies contract on BaseScan
6. Saves deployment info to `deployments/baseMainnet.json`

**Expected output:**
```
üöÄ Deploying UnchainedTickets to Base Mainnet...

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: You are deploying to MAINNET!
‚ö†Ô∏è  This will use REAL ETH and cannot be undone!

üìã Deployment Configuration:
  Network: baseMainnet
  Chain ID: 8453
  Deployer: 0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
  Balance: 0.1000 ETH
  Base URI: https://unchainedtickets.xyz/api/metadata/

üî¥ Are you SURE you want to deploy to MAINNET? Type 'DEPLOY' to continue:
```

**Type:** `DEPLOY` and press Enter.

**Deployment will take ~2-3 minutes.**

**Save the contract address!** It will be displayed and saved to `deployments/baseMainnet.json`.

---

### Step 5: Grant MINTER_ROLE to Minting Wallet

After deployment, the contract deployer (your wallet) has the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE. You need to grant MINTER_ROLE to the minting wallet so it can mint NFTs.

**Check current deployment info:**
```bash
cat deployments/baseMainnet.json
```

**Grant MINTER_ROLE:**

Create a script or use Hardhat console:

```bash
# Using Hardhat console
npx hardhat console --network baseMainnet
```

Then in the console:
```javascript
const contractAddress = "0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
const mintingWallet = "0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0"

const UnchainedTickets = await ethers.getContractFactory("UnchainedTickets")
const contract = UnchainedTickets.attach(contractAddress)

// Get MINTER_ROLE
const MINTER_ROLE = await contract.MINTER_ROLE()
console.log("MINTER_ROLE:", MINTER_ROLE)

// Grant role
const tx = await contract.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, mintingWallet)
await tx.wait()
console.log("‚úÖ MINTER_ROLE granted to:", mintingWallet)
```

**Verify role was granted:**
```javascript
const hasRole = await contract.hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, mintingWallet)
console.log("Has MINTER_ROLE:", hasRole) // Should be true
```

**Alternative:** Use the grant-minter-role script (if it exists):
```bash
node scripts/grant-minter-role.cjs --network baseMainnet --contract 0xYOUR_CONTRACT --minter 0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
```

---

### Step 6: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Now that the contract is deployed, update Vercel with production configuration.

**Go to:** [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Add/Update these variables for PRODUCTION ONLY:**

| Variable | Value | Environment |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` | `8453` | Production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` | `mainnet` | Production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE` | `false` | Production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL` | `https://mainnet.base.org` | Production |
| `NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | `0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT` | Production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | `0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT` | Production |
| `MINTING_PRIVATE_KEY` | `0xd34c899e81238a09e2adc43bc922ab8a81d00e281793497ef0bc73c43c2e1205` | Production |
| `MINTING_WALLET_ADDRESS` | `0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0` | Production |

**IMPORTANT:** Check **ONLY** "Production" environment (uncheck Preview & Development)

**Verification:**
- [ ] All 8 variables added
- [ ] All set to "Production" only
- [ ] Preview/Development still have testnet values (chain ID 84532)

---

### Step 7: Deploy to Vercel Production

**Trigger production deployment:**

**Option A: Push to main branch**
```bash
git add deployments/baseMainnet.json
git commit -m "chore: add mainnet contract deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual redeploy**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click three dots ‚Üí Redeploy
4. Select "Use existing build cache: No"
5. Click "Redeploy"

**Monitor deployment:**
- Watch deployment logs in Vercel
- Look for errors related to environment variables
- Verify build completes successfully

---

### Step 8: Verify Deployment

#### 8a. Verify Contract on BaseScan

Visit: `https://basescan.org/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

**Check:**
- [ ] Contract is verified (green checkmark)
- [ ] Source code is visible
- [ ] Contract has correct name "UnchainedTickets"
- [ ] Deployer address matches your wallet

#### 8b. Verify Environment Configuration

**Run verification script:**
```bash
# Set environment to production temporarily
export VERCEL_ENV=production
export NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=8453
export NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=mainnet
export NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_MAINNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

node scripts/verify-env-config.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Chain ID: 8453 (Base Mainnet)
‚úÖ Network: mainnet
‚úÖ Dev Mode: false (Real payments)
‚úÖ RPC URL: https://mainnet.base.org
‚úÖ Contract Address: 0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
‚úÖ Smart contract found on chain
```

#### 8c. Verify Minting Wallet Has Role

```bash
npx hardhat console --network baseMainnet
```

```javascript
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("UnchainedTickets", "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS")
const MINTER_ROLE = await contract.MINTER_ROLE()
const hasMinterRole = await contract.hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, "0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0")
console.log("Minting wallet has MINTER_ROLE:", hasMinterRole)
```

**Should output:** `true`

---

### Step 9: Test Production Deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è Test with small amounts first!**

#### Test Checklist:

1. **Create Test Event**
   - [ ] Go to production URL: https://unchainedtickets.xyz
   - [ ] Log in with dev wallet
   - [ ] Create a test event with cheap tickets ($1-5)
   - [ ] Verify event saves to database
   - [ ] Check event appears on events page

2. **Register Event On-Chain**
   - [ ] In event dashboard, click "Register On-Chain"
   - [ ] Verify transaction succeeds on Base Mainnet
   - [ ] Check transaction on BaseScan
   - [ ] Verify `onChainEventId` saved to database

3. **Test Ticket Purchase**
   - [ ] Buy a ticket as a test user
   - [ ] Verify payment processes (use real payment, not mock)
   - [ ] Check NFT mints to buyer's wallet
   - [ ] Verify NFT appears on OpenSea/BaseScan
   - [ ] Check metadata loads correctly

4. **Test Metadata API**
   - [ ] Visit: `https://unchainedtickets.xyz/api/metadata/1`
   - [ ] Verify JSON response with name, description, image
   - [ ] Test with multiple token IDs
   - [ ] Check image URLs work

5. **Monitor Minting Wallet Balance**
   - [ ] Check balance: https://basescan.org/address/0x0792dfF6A79E81bB83280fb8E57E488a2907bbA0
   - [ ] Verify ETH is being used for mints
   - [ ] Set up alert if balance drops below 0.01 ETH

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Monitor and Maintain

**Daily:**
- Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
- Monitor Sentry for exceptions (if configured)
- Check minting wallet balance

**Weekly:**
- Review BaseScan transactions
- Check NFT metadata is loading
- Verify events registering on-chain successfully

**Monthly:**
- Refill minting wallet if balance < 0.02 ETH
- Review gas costs and optimize if needed
- Check for Hardhat/Solidity updates

### Security

- [ ] Remove `.env` files from local machine after deployment
- [ ] Verify mainnet private key stored only in password manager and Vercel
- [ ] Enable 2FA on Vercel account
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment protection (require approval for production)
- [ ] Review Vercel access logs regularly

### Backup

- [ ] Save `deployments/baseMainnet.json` to secure backup
- [ ] Document contract address in team password manager
- [ ] Keep copy of contract ABI in secure location
- [ ] Save deployment transaction hash

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment fails with "Insufficient funds"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check deployer wallet balance
npx hardhat console --network baseMainnet
```
```javascript
const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners()
console.log("Balance:", await ethers.provider.getBalance(deployer.address))
```

Fund wallet with more ETH and retry.

### Issue: Contract verification fails

**Solution:** Manually verify:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network baseMainnet YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "https://unchainedtickets.xyz/api/metadata/"
```

### Issue: Minting fails in production

**Checks:**
1. Verify minting wallet has MINTER_ROLE:
   ```bash
   # See Step 8c above
   ```
2. Check minting wallet has ETH for gas
3. Verify Vercel has correct `MINTING_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. Check Vercel logs for error messages

### Issue: Environment variables not switching

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Verify production vars are set to "Production" only
3. Verify testnet vars are set to "Preview + Development" only
4. Redeploy production

---

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to rollback to testnet:

1. **In Vercel:**
   - Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` to `84532` (Production)
   - Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` to `testnet` (Production)
   - Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE` to `true` (Production)
   - Update contract address to testnet address
   - Redeploy

2. **Alternative:** Create new deployment from specific commit:
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
   - Find last working testnet deployment
   - Click ‚Üí Redeploy

**Note:** This doesn't delete the mainnet contract, just switches the app back to testnet.
