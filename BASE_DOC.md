Integrating Coinbase OnchainKit & OnchainTestKit for an NFT Ticketing App
Overview:
Your NFT ticketing app (Polygon, Hardhat, Vitest, React) can benefit from Coinbase’s latest developer tools. Coinbase OnchainKit (with Coinbase Commerce’s USDC onchain payments) and OnchainTestKit offer new ways to improve payment flows, testing reliability, and user onboarding – all without massive codebase changes. Below, we explore how to integrate these tools, step-by-step implementation guidance, and best practices. We also highlight how they can give you a competitive edge at a hackathon and support long-term production success.
Coinbase OnchainKit & USDC Onchain Ticketing Integration
Coinbase’s OnchainKit is a front-end SDK that simplifies Web3 wallet integration and checkout flows. Paired with Coinbase Commerce’s USDC onchain payments, it enables a smooth ticket purchase experience using cryptocurrency (specifically USDC) with minimal custom code. Coinbase even provides a full Onchain Tickets demo app that you can reference or fork[1][2]. Key features of this integration include:
• Wallet Connection UI: OnchainKit provides pre-built React components for connecting wallets. For example, you can wrap your app in a <Wallet> provider and include a <ConnectWallet /> button for users to easily link MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet[3]. This saves you from writing custom wallet connection logic and supports multiple wallets out-of-the-box (improving user access).
• USDC Checkout Button: With OnchainKit, you can drop in a <Checkout> component that links to a Coinbase Commerce product ID for your ticket. Inside <Checkout>, the <CheckoutButton /> and <CheckoutStatus /> sub-components handle the onchain payment flow for you[3]. Essentially, Coinbase Commerce manages the payment transaction, and OnchainKit provides the UI/UX. By creating a ticket product in Coinbase Commerce and plugging its productId into the Checkout component, you enable a secure “Pay with USDC” button in your app[4].
• Secure Onchain Payment Flow: When a user clicks the Checkout button, Coinbase’s system will facilitate the payment in USDC onchain. Under the hood, Coinbase Commerce uses an Onchain Payment Protocol that can accept hundreds of different cryptocurrencies from the payer and automatically swap them to USDC for the merchant (your app) via decentralized exchanges[5][6]. This means users could pay with various tokens (or even via fiat through Coinbase’s platform), yet you receive a stable USDC amount, eliminating volatility risk. The protocol’s smart contract (Transfers.sol) is deployed on Base, Ethereum, and Polygon networks[7] – so it’s compatible with your Polygon-based app. Coinbase acts as an operator in this system (handling intent signing and compliance checks) to ensure payments are valid and coming from allowed addresses[8][9], adding an extra layer of security.
• Hosted vs. Embedded Checkout: By default, Coinbase Commerce provides a hosted payment page for charges you create (you get a URL for users to complete payment)[10][11]. However, using OnchainKit’s Checkout component likely embeds this process into your app or triggers a wallet flow directly, creating a more seamless experience. The Commerce API returns unique charge IDs for each payment request, which you can use to track status[12]. In the simple OnchainKit integration, much of this is abstracted – you supply the product ID and Coinbase handles generating the charge and monitoring the blockchain for the payment. The <CheckoutStatus /> component can display real-time status (paid, pending, etc.), improving user feedback without manual polling.
• Example Integration Code: In your React app, after installing OnchainKit, you might do something like:
import { OnchainKitProvider } from "@coinbase/onchainkit";  
import { Wallet, ConnectWallet } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/wallet";  
import { Checkout, CheckoutButton, CheckoutStatus } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/checkout";

export default function TicketPage() {
return (
<OnchainKitProvider apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_CDP_KEY}>
<Wallet><ConnectWallet /></Wallet>
<Checkout productId="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID">
<CheckoutButton />
<CheckoutStatus />
</Checkout>
</OnchainKitProvider>
);
}
This snippet sets up the OnchainKit context with your API key, displays a Connect Wallet button, and a Checkout section tied to your Coinbase Commerce productId. The Coinbase Developer Portal guide shows a similar code example where ConnectWallet and CheckoutButton are used inside providers[2].
• Backend Charge Creation (Optional): If your ticket pricing is dynamic or you want to attach user-specific metadata (e.g. buyer’s name, email, number of tickets), you can integrate the Coinbase Commerce API on your backend. In the Onchain Tickets demo, a Next.js API route securely creates a charge via REST API when the user is ready to pay[13][14]. For example, you’d send a POST request to https://api.commerce.coinbase.com/charges with JSON payload including local_price (amount in USDC) and pricing_type: fixed_price. You also can include a metadata object (e.g. ticketID, buyer info) which Coinbase will return back upon payment – useful for verifying which order was paid. This backend step ensures your API key remains secret (never exposed in front-end) and allows custom charge parameters. The endpoint returns a chargeId which your front-end can use to redirect to Coinbase’s hosted checkout or simply monitor status. Below is a simplified example (from Coinbase’s docs) of a backend route creating a USDC charge:
// app/api/createCharge.ts (pseudo-code)
const res = await fetch("https://api.commerce.coinbase.com/charges", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"X-CC-Api-Key": process.env.COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY,
"Content-Type": "application/json"
},
body: JSON.stringify({
local_price: { amount, currency: "USDC" },
pricing_type: "fixed_price",
metadata: { buyerName: name, email, ticketCount }
})
});
const data = await res.json();
return NextResponse.json({ chargeId: data.data?.id });
In the Coinbase sample, this logic is in a Next.js route and returns the chargeId to the client[13][14]. On the client side, you’d call this endpoint when the user confirms their order details, then retrieve the chargeId. If you are not using the <Checkout> component for embedded flow, you could redirect the user to the hosted payment page URL associated with that charge. However, if using <Checkout> from OnchainKit, much of this is streamlined – you may only need to use a backend if you want to customize pricing or metadata beyond a static product. In many cases, simply creating a fixed-price product in Coinbase Commerce and using Checkout with productId is enough for a simple NFT sale (price is known upfront).
How this benefits your app: Integrating Coinbase’s payment system allows you to accept stablecoin payments easily without writing a custom ERC20 payment handler in your smart contract. Users can pay with USDC (which is price-stable) instead of volatile MATIC/ETH, and even pay with other cryptocurrencies or fiat while you receive USDC behind the scenes[5][6]. This reduces volatility risk for both you and the users (ticket prices remain consistent in fiat terms) and lowers the barrier for participation (a user with any major crypto can pay). Furthermore, Coinbase’s protocol handles things like on-chain swaps, payment monitoring, and compliance checks automatically[8][9], so your team doesn’t need to implement complex payment logic or worry about illicit funds. The integration is also EVM-compatible, meaning you can continue deploying on Polygon – Coinbase Commerce will simply use Polygon’s USDC and the Transfers.sol contract on Polygon for settlements[7].
Wallet Integration Improvements: Using OnchainKit’s wallet component can enhance your wallet onboarding UX. It will support Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask by default, giving users a choice (and covering a wider audience). It likely also handles network switching prompts if the user is on the wrong network, etc., as it’s designed for Base but works with any EVM network. Because OnchainKit is a high-level SDK, it can simplify your React code for connecting wallets and transacting. If your current implementation uses something like Wagmi or a custom web3 modal, you can gradually replace or augment it with OnchainKit’s <ConnectWallet> for a polished experience. This change can be minimal (just adding a new button/component) and does not require overhauling your entire app. For hackathon purposes, showcasing Coinbase’s wallet integration might impress judges (as it signals ease of use), and long-term it means less maintenance burden on custom wallet logic.
Fiat On-Ramp Consideration: While not directly part of Coinbase Commerce’s onchain ticketing module, Coinbase offers an Onramp API/SDK that lets users buy crypto (like USDC) with fiat (credit card, bank, Apple Pay) natively in your app[15]. This could be a future enhancement: for users who don’t have any crypto, you could integrate Coinbase’s Onramp widget to let them purchase USDC with fiat and then proceed to buy the NFT ticket. Using the Onramp in conjunction with the USDC Checkout provides a seamless fiat-to-NFT flow without leaving your app[16]. This is an advanced feature and can be added later, but it’s worth noting as a long-term benefit – it further lowers the barrier for non-crypto users to participate in your platform.
OnchainTestKit for End-to-End Web3 Testing
Coinbase’s OnchainTestKit is an end-to-end testing framework specifically designed for blockchain applications. It builds on Playwright (a browser automation tool) to simulate real user interactions with your dApp, including wallet operations[17]. Here’s how OnchainTestKit can improve your testing setup and reliability:
• Automated Wallet & Transaction Flows: OnchainTestKit can programmatically control web wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet in a headless browser. It automates common user actions – for example: connecting a wallet, switching networks, approving transactions, signing messages, and even token swaps or contract interactions[17][18]. In practice, you can write a test that launches your React app in a browser, clicks “Connect Wallet”, approves the connection in a simulated MetaMask, then clicks “Buy Ticket”, and confirms the onchain transaction. The framework will handle the MetaMask pop-up and signature internally. This allows you to test the full purchase flow of your NFT ticketing app, catching any integration issues between front-end, wallet, and smart contract.
• Type-Safe and Integrates with Hardhat: OnchainTestKit is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for its APIs, which means you get compile-time checks and editor autocomplete for your tests[19]. You can likely use it alongside Hardhat or Anvil as the local blockchain. In fact, OnchainTestKit can spin up a local Anvil (Ethereum dev node) for you, or you can point it to a Hardhat node if you prefer. It supports forking mainnet or running isolated test chains on dynamic ports, which is great for running tests in parallel without state conflicts[20][21]. You might continue using Vitest for unit tests (e.g., testing smart contract functions in isolation with Hardhat), and add OnchainTestKit for browser-level integration tests. They serve different purposes and can coexist.
• Why This Improves Reliability: Currently, with Hardhat + Vitest, you’re probably testing your contracts and maybe some off-chain logic in Node, but not the actual UI or wallet behavior. Many bugs in dApps occur at the integration level – e.g., wallet not connecting properly, transactions failing to propagate, incorrect network handling, etc. Manually testing these flows is time-consuming and error-prone[19]. OnchainTestKit allows you to automate end-to-end tests that run quickly and consistently. You can set up a suite of tests to run before deploys or before the hackathon demo to ensure everything works. For instance, a test could verify that when a user buys a ticket, their wallet balance decreases by the price and they receive an NFT (by checking contract state or a UI element). Another test could simulate an edge case (like insufficient USDC balance, or user cancels the transaction) to see that your app handles it gracefully. By covering these scenarios, you drastically reduce the chance of last-minute surprises.
• Usage and Integration: To use OnchainTestKit, you’d install it as a dev dependency (yarn add -D @coinbase/onchaintestkit)[22]. You will also need Playwright (which it likely brings along or you install separately). Then you can write tests using their API. According to Coinbase, it has a “fluent configuration” and a set of high-level actions. For example, you might write something like:
import { TestKit, MetaMaskWallet } from "@coinbase/onchaintestkit";

test("Full ticket purchase flow", async () => {
const tk = await TestKit.init({
// configuration for network and wallets
network: { chainId: 137, rpcUrl: "http://localhost:8545" }, // Polygon or a fork
wallets: [ new MetaMaskWallet({ seed: "test seed phrase" }) ]
});
const page = await tk.newPage(); // launches a browser page with wallets configured

await page.goto("http://localhost:3000"); // your local app
await page.getByText("Connect Wallet").click();
await tk.expectWalletConnected(); // utility to verify wallet connected

await page.getByText("Buy Ticket").click();
// OnchainTestKit will auto-approve the transaction in MetaMask
await tk.expectTransactionSucceeded(); // verify tx went through

// Optionally, check on-chain state or UI for confirmation
const tokenId = await tk.readContract(yourNFTContract, "ownerOf", [ticketId]);
expect(tokenId).toEqual(tk.wallets[0].address);
});
The above is illustrative pseudo-code; refer to Coinbase’s examples for exact syntax. The key idea is that OnchainTestKit provides helpers to manage wallets and blockchain state in tests. It handles network switching and transaction approval flows automatically[18], which is a huge convenience. This means your tests can focus on the high-level outcome (e.g., “user successfully mints an NFT and inventory updates”) rather than fiddling with low-level wallet mechanics each time.
• Parallel and CI-Friendly: The framework supports running tests in parallel with isolated environments (each test can have its own fresh blockchain state on a separate port)[20][21]. This is great for speed and also means one test won’t interfere with another (no shared state unless you intend it). You can integrate these tests into your CI pipeline for continuous integration – ensuring that even as you modify code post-hackathon, core user flows remain working. Since everything is code-driven (no manual clicking through a browser), you’ll catch regressions quickly.
Adopting OnchainTestKit Safely: You don’t need to refactor your app at all to add OnchainTestKit – it interacts with your deployed contracts and front-end like a real user would. Thus, you can introduce it at the late stage of development just for testing purposes without touching production code. Start by writing a couple of critical path tests (e.g., “purchase ticket successfully” and “ticket sold out state prevents purchase”) to gain confidence. Use your existing Hardhat setup to provide a test blockchain (OnchainTestKit can work with Hardhat’s JSON-RPC or you can use its built-in Anvil). Over time, you can expand this test suite, but even a few end-to-end tests will significantly boost reliability. At the hackathon, having automated tests sets you apart – you can even show a quick clip of tests running to judges, underlining how robust and polished your project is.
Improving Payment Flows & User Experience with Coinbase Tools
By leveraging Coinbase’s payment and wallet tooling, your NFT ticketing app can achieve a more user-friendly, flexible, and secure payment flow:
• Multiple Payment Options (w/ USDC Standardization): Instead of forcing users to have MATIC or a specific crypto, Coinbase Commerce allows them to pay with their choice of cryptocurrency while you receive a stable USDC amount[6]. This flexibility can make a big difference in user conversion – someone holding ETH, DAI, or other tokens can still easily buy a ticket. Coinbase’s smart contracts will perform the swap onchain to USDC, instantly and atomically at checkout[5], so neither party is exposed to price swings during the transaction. The user experience is akin to a traditional purchase: they pay the listed price (in whatever asset they choose) and you get the exact ticket price in a stablecoin.
• Fiat-to-Crypto (Future Integration): If you foresee mainstream users (who might not have crypto wallets) using your platform, Coinbase’s ecosystem has solutions to onboard them. The Coinbase Pay Onramp SDK lets users purchase crypto with fiat inside your app[16]. This could be integrated such that a user clicks “Buy with Credit Card”, completes a purchase of USDC (or even directly an NFT voucher) via Apple Pay/credit card, and then the onchain transaction is triggered for the NFT. While this is a more advanced flow and may be out of scope for your immediate launch, knowing it’s available means your app can scale to broader audiences post-hackathon. You won’t need to build your own fiat onramp; you can plug into Coinbase’s regulated infrastructure for that. Combining this with the onchain Commerce protocol essentially covers all payer types: crypto veterans and newbies alike.
• Enhanced Wallet UX: OnchainKit’s wallet connectors not only simplify your code but also improve the developer onboarding experience. Future contributors to your project won’t have to decipher custom wallet integration code; they can refer to Coinbase’s documentation. The wallet component is tried-and-tested, likely reducing edge-case bugs (like incorrect network handling or provider issues). It also may include nice UI touches, for example, showing the user’s address or balance once connected, or styling that is consistent with Coinbase’s design. All of this polish can make your app feel more professional. Additionally, since OnchainKit is Coinbase-maintained, you benefit from updates and support – e.g., if a new wallet comes along or an API changes, Coinbase may update the kit, and you can upgrade rather than fixing it yourself.
• Security & Trust Signals: By integrating Coinbase’s services, you implicitly leverage Coinbase’s reputation. Users and hackathon judges might view the Coinbase Commerce checkout as a trust signal – they know a reliable third party is handling the payment. The compliance measures (screening wallets against sanctions, etc.) add security, and automatic conversion to USDC ensures you’re not holding volatile assets[5][8]. These factors are important for a production app (reducing legal and financial risks) and can be mentioned as a strength in presentations (“We use Coinbase’s secure onchain payment protocol, so funds are handled safely and compliantly”). It shows you’re thinking beyond just “make it work” – you’re making it robust and business-ready.
Ensuring Minimal Code Disruption and Smooth Adoption
One of your concerns is that adopting these tools late in development could break existing logic. Here’s how to integrate them incrementally and safely without overhauling your codebase:
• Parallel Integration (Feature Flags): You can introduce Coinbase-powered flows alongside your current implementation, rather than replacing everything at once. For example, keep your existing NFT mint function that maybe accepts MATIC, but add an optional USDC purchase button using Coinbase Commerce. This could simply live in your UI as another payment method. During testing (or the hackathon demo) you might showcase the Coinbase flow, but if anything goes wrong, your original flow is still there as a fallback. Over time, once you’re confident, you could make the Coinbase/USDC method the primary path.
• Modular Code Addition: OnchainKit can be added as a new provider/component in your React app without affecting other parts. It’s essentially wrapping some of your UI with context providers and adding new components. This won’t interfere with unrelated state or logic. For instance, you can include <OnchainKitProvider> at a high level and place <ConnectWallet> in your header next to (or instead of) your current connect button. If something fails, you still have MetaMask (or your existing wallet connection) possibly working in parallel. The key is to test this thoroughly in a staging environment. Fortunately, because OnchainKit is designed to be straightforward, integration should be quick – Coinbase’s example got a basic app running in a few steps[23][2].
• Backend Isolation: The Coinbase Commerce API integration (creating charges, etc.) can be done in a separate API route or microservice. It doesn’t conflict with your smart contract logic; it’s more about handling payment requests and confirmations. By isolating this in its own endpoint (/api/createCharge as shown above), you ensure that any issues or changes in payment handling don’t affect the rest of your app’s functionality. If for some reason the Coinbase API is down or misconfigured, your core app (ticket listing, etc.) still runs – you’d just disable the USDC checkout temporarily. This modular approach keeps risk low.
• Smart Contract Considerations: Since your NFT smart contract was built for Polygon and likely accepts payments in MATIC (or maybe it’s free mint and you charge off-chain), you might wonder how Coinbase Commerce ties in. In the Coinbase flow, the payment doesn’t directly hit your NFT contract – it goes to the merchant wallet (which could be your team’s wallet or a Coinbase-managed wallet) in USDC. Then you need to deliver the NFT to the buyer after payment. To do this without modifying your core contract logic too much, consider implementing an admin or backend-triggered mint function if you haven’t already. For example, you might have an adminMint(to, ticketId) that only your team can call, or a claimTicket(code) mechanism. When a Coinbase payment succeeds, you get the buyer’s wallet address (either they connect a wallet via OnchainKit or you ask for it in the checkout flow metadata). Your backend (or a cloud function via Coinbase Commerce webhook) can then call the NFT contract’s mint function to issue the ticket NFT to that address. This way, the payment and mint flows are decoupled but linked by your off-chain logic. Importantly, adding such a function to your contract (if not there) is a minimal change that doesn’t alter existing token logic; it just provides an extra route to mint. Make sure to protect it (e.g., only callable by the contract owner or a designated role). This approach lets you integrate Coinbase payments without rewriting your whole mint mechanism. During the hackathon demo, you might simulate this by manually calling the mint after a payment, or you could set up a quick listener. For production, you’d automate it via webhooks or periodic checks of charge status.
• Testing During Integration: As you add these new components and flows, use OnchainTestKit (and your existing tests) to verify you haven’t broken anything. For example, write a test that ensures a user can still mint via the old method (if you keep it) and another for the new USDC method. OnchainTestKit’s ability to simulate different scenarios (including network conditions or wallet types) can help you ensure that the introduction of OnchainKit hasn’t, say, broken your app for Metamask users on Polygon. Because OnchainKit is meant to work with Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask, it should be smooth, but it’s wise to test multiple wallets. You can script OnchainTestKit to run the same purchase test with two different wallets (Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask) to ensure both succeed – thanks to the multi-wallet support in the test framework[24][25].
• Documentation and Team Alignment: Coinbase’s developer docs are quite detailed (as seen in the Onchain Tickets guide and testkit guide). Share these with your team to get everyone up to speed. The clear examples and templates (Coinbase even provides a full Onchain NFT app template and Onchain Commerce app template as references[26]) can accelerate understanding. New contributors can look at those as a blueprint, which reduces the learning curve of your code. Essentially, by aligning with Coinbase’s patterns, you make the project more approachable for others (important if you plan to open-source or continue development post-hackathon).
Best Practices and Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Below is a consolidated list of best practices and steps to implement these tools into your NFT ticketing app. This serves as a roadmap to integrate Coinbase Commerce USDC payments and OnchainTestKit while minimizing disruption:
• 1. Install the Required SDKs: Add Coinbase’s SDKs to your project. For the front-end, install OnchainKit (e.g., npm install @coinbase/onchainkit) and for testing, install OnchainTestKit as a dev dependency (npm install -D @coinbase/onchaintestkit). Ensure you also have Playwright installed or let OnchainTestKit set it up as documented. Importantly, check the peer dependencies (Node version, etc.) as specified in Coinbase’s docs to avoid any environment issues.
• 2. Obtain API Keys and Configure Environment: Sign up for Coinbase Developer Portal if you haven’t, and get an OnchainKit API key (CDP API key)[27]. Also create a Coinbase Commerce account and generate an API key for Commerce. In your .env or environment config, set NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_CDP_KEY=<your OnchainKit API key> and COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY=<your Commerce API key> (and any other keys as needed). Never expose the Commerce API key on the client – use it in backend routes only. Having these set up early will make development and testing smoother.
• 3. Create a Ticket Product on Coinbase Commerce: Through the Coinbase Commerce dashboard, create a product representing your NFT ticket. Set the price in USDC (or fiat equivalent – Commerce will handle conversion if needed). Each product will have a unique productId. Note that in Coinbase’s Onchain Ticketing flow, the product is basically a template for a payment (with a fixed price)[4]. If your app sells tickets at different prices or quantities, you might create multiple products or plan to use the Commerce API for dynamic charges. For a hackathon, one product (e.g., “General Admission Ticket – 0.5 USDC”) is probably sufficient. Copy the productId for integration.
• 4. Integrate OnchainKit Providers in Your Frontend: Following Coinbase’s quickstart, integrate the OnchainKit context at the root of your app. For example, in a Next.js or React app, you might have an \_app.js or a top-level component; wrap it with OnchainKitProvider and pass your API key[27]. Also include the <Wallet> provider if required (depending on OnchainKit version) to manage the connected wallet state. This foundational step ensures that any OnchainKit components used in children can function (for instance, it might handle connecting to Coinbase’s services in the background).
• 5. Add the Wallet Connect UI: Replace or augment your existing wallet connect button with Coinbase’s <ConnectWallet /> component[2]. This one component can handle connecting to MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet. You can keep your original logic as fallback if needed, but using the standardized component will reduce custom code. Test that you can connect both a MetaMask account and a Coinbase Wallet (if you have one) to ensure it’s working. The OnchainKit ConnectWallet will likely prompt the user to choose a wallet if multiple are available, which is user-friendly.
• 6. Embed the USDC Checkout Button: In the part of your UI where the user initiates the purchase, use the <Checkout> component. Wrap the <CheckoutButton /> and <CheckoutStatus /> inside <Checkout productId="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID">...</Checkout> as shown in Coinbase’s demo code[3]. This sets up the context for a specific product purchase. The CheckoutButton when clicked will start the payment flow (e.g., open a modal or trigger a transaction), and CheckoutStatus can display feedback like “Payment Pending” or “Payment Complete”. Ensure that the productId you provide matches the one from step 3. If you have multiple ticket types, you might need multiple Checkout components or a dynamic way to set the productId based on user selection.
• 7. (Optional) Implement Advanced Checkout Features: If you require collecting user info (name, email) or selling multiple tickets in one go, you should implement a multi-step flow as outlined in Coinbase’s intermediate guide[28][29]. This involves creating a confirmation page, passing along form data (perhaps using URL parameters or context), and then calling a secure backend endpoint to create a custom charge with the total amount. In practice:
• Create a Next.js API route (or equivalent in your stack) /api/createCharge that reads an amount and metadata from the request and calls Coinbase Commerce API with those details[13][14]. Use your Commerce API key in the request header. Return the generated chargeId.
• In your front-end confirmation step, call this API (e.g., const { chargeId } = await fetch('/api/createCharge', {method:'POST', body: JSON.stringify({amount, metadata})}))[30][31]. Upon getting the chargeId, you have two choices: (a) Use Coinbase’s hosted checkout page by redirecting the user to the charge.url (if returned), or (b) if OnchainKit supports it, feed the chargeId into a component to handle the onchain payment. The simpler method is (a) – redirect to Coinbase’s payment page where the user completes the payment, then use a webhook or polling to know when it’s paid.
• Set up a webhook (on Coinbase Commerce dashboard) to listen for charge paid events, or poll the charge status from your frontend/backend. Once payment is confirmed, proceed to mint the NFT or show a success screen.
• Inventory Management: If you use Airtable or any inventory tracking (as in the Coinbase demo’s advanced section[32]), implement those after basic payment works. For example, disable the purchase if inventory is 0, and call an /api/updateInventory to decrement count after a successful purchase[33]. This is ancillary but important for production to avoid overselling.
• 8. Connect Payment to NFT Minting: Ensure there’s a mechanism to deliver the NFT upon payment success. If your current flow already mints the NFT as soon as a on-chain transaction is done (typical when user pays directly to the contract), note that in the Coinbase flow the user is not directly interacting with your NFT contract. You will likely handle minting off-chain. A straightforward approach: after payment, call your contract’s mint function from the backend. You might use Hardhat scripts or ethers.js with a privileged signer to do this. For instance, have your backend (Node.js) load a wallet (with a private key you control, e.g., an admin key) and call NFTContract.safeMint(buyerAddress, tokenURI/metadata) once you confirm payment. This could be triggered by the Coinbase Commerce webhook event for charge confirmed. Make sure to only mint once per charge and handle idempotency (Coinbase might send multiple webhook events). If you prefer not to use a backend for minting, you could also generate a one-time claim code: after payment, show the user a unique code or NFT voucher that they can input into a contract function (along with their wallet) to claim their NFT. However, this introduces more user steps, so automating mint from backend is more seamless. In summary, plan how the “money in → ticket out” link is executed:
• During hackathon: You might simply simulate this by checking your Coinbase Commerce dashboard and manually minting via Hardhat console for demonstration. But describe the automated approach in documentation for completeness.
• For production: Implement the full loop with either webhooks or periodic checks (Commerce API allows retrieving charge by ID to check status[34][35]). When implementing webhooks, remember to verify the signatures Coinbase sends to ensure authenticity.
• 9. Introduce OnchainTestKit Tests: Now that new payment and wallet features are in place, write tests to validate them. Start the local blockchain (Hardhat or Anvil) and run your development server. Then use OnchainTestKit to automate a browser pointing to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port). Write a test case for a successful purchase:
• Connect wallet (the testkit should handle the popup).
• Initiate purchase (click the button).
• If using hosted page, you might not automate the Coinbase checkout easily without a test wallet having crypto – but if using a local onchain flow (e.g., on a testnet or a fork where you can simulate the transaction), testkit can confirm the transaction through MetaMask. OnchainTestKit was built with OnchainKit in mind, so it can likely simulate the entire OnchainKit <Checkout> flow by auto-signing the onchain transaction that Coinbase’s protocol requires.
• Assert that the app shows a success state (e.g., “Payment Complete” or an order confirmation with an NFT ID). If your app updates inventory or UI, check that too.
• Optionally, query the contract via OnchainTestKit’s provider to ensure the NFT exists for the user.
Also write a test for an error scenario (like user rejects the transaction or has insufficient funds) to see that your app handles it (maybe shows an error message and allows retry). These tests will not only give you peace of mind, they can be used to demonstrate your app’s robustness. Remember to use the type-safe APIs of OnchainTestKit for actions like expectWalletConnected() or expectTransactionSucceeded() which are built to simplify these assertions[19]. Running these tests should be as simple as a npx playwright test or similar command.
• 10. Optimize and Refine: With everything integrated, do a thorough run-through. Ensure that adding OnchainKit hasn’t slowed down your app significantly (it shouldn’t – it’s mostly UI components and some script include for Coinbase). Check mobile compatibility if relevant (Coinbase Wallet’s deep linking, etc., if a user is on mobile web). Also consider appearance – OnchainKit might have default styles; adjust the CSS or use their theme options if available[36] so that the wallet button and checkout modal match your app’s branding or at least look presentable. For OnchainTestKit, ensure your CI environment can run browsers (you might need a headless mode or CI flags).
Following the above steps will incrementally layer in Coinbase’s capabilities to your nearly-finished app, without tearing up its foundations. Now you have both a cutting-edge payment solution and a robust testing harness integrated.
Hackathon Edge and Long-Term Success
Adopting Coinbase’s developer tools can significantly boost your hackathon project’s impact and set you up for long-run success:
• Hackathon Judges’ Perspective: Incorporating these tools shows that your project isn’t just a basic prototype – it’s leveraging state-of-the-art solutions to solve real problems. For instance, accepting stablecoin USDC via Coinbase Commerce demonstrates you’ve thought about user trust, volatility, and seamless payments (a judge might note: “This team enables credit-card-like simplicity in a crypto app!”). Using OnchainTestKit signals a commitment to quality; very few hackathon teams write tests, let alone end-to-end automated ones. This can differentiate you as professionals. You can explicitly mention “We integrated Coinbase’s OnchainKit for one-click crypto payments and wrote end-to-end tests with OnchainTestKit to ensure reliability[19],” which not only name-drops the sponsor’s tech (always a plus in sponsored hackathons) but also gives confidence that your demo will work without hiccups. If there’s a prize for best use of a sponsor API or similar, you’re hitting that criteria solidly.
• Real-World Readiness: Beyond the hackathon, these integrations make your app more viable as a production product. Coinbase Commerce handling payments means you can scale to many users and currencies without having to constantly update smart contracts to accept new tokens or worry about treasury management – Coinbase effectively becomes your payment backend. The compliance and security features (such as KYC’ed flows for Coinbase users and sanctions checks[8]) become crucial if you ever deal with large volumes or corporate partners. Meanwhile, OnchainTestKit will be invaluable as you continue development: when adding features or upgrading contracts, you can rely on your test suite to catch regressions, which is essential for safe iteration in a Web3 app that involves financial transactions.
• Minimal Technical Debt: By using well-maintained SDKs, you avoid reinventing the wheel and incur less technical debt. Coinbase will update these SDKs with improvements and security patches. For example, if a new wallet standard emerges or an update to the Base/Polygon protocol is needed, Coinbase’s team may handle it and you can upgrade the package, rather than refactoring your own code. This longevity is important if your project gains users or investors – they will ask if your platform is secure and scalable. You can point out that major pieces of your stack (payments, wallets) are handled by Coinbase’s infrastructure, which is a positive sign.
• Future Feature Expansion: With OnchainKit, you have access to other Coinbase modules easily. The navigation in Coinbase’s docs shows components for swaps, onramps, identity, and even an AI integration kit[37][38]. This means adding things like a “buy crypto” option or identity verification or even deploying on your own app-specific chain (Appchains) could be done with less effort by utilizing the same OnchainKit framework. Your hackathon project could thus be a seed that grows into a more complex application leveraging the whole Coinbase Developer Stack. Judges and evaluators love to see that your project can evolve beyond the hackathon – and you’ve set it up to do exactly that.
In summary, integrating Coinbase’s OnchainKit for USDC payments and OnchainTestKit for testing will enhance your NFT ticketing app’s payment flexibility, reliability, and user experience. You’ll be able to accept on-chain USDC payments securely with minimal coding[13][14], and ensure your smart contracts and frontend work together flawlessly through comprehensive tests[19]. Critically, you can adopt these tools gradually, without breaking what already works – a key consideration given your imminent launch. By following best practices and the step-by-step guide above, you can smoothly layer Coinbase’s technology into your project. The payoff is a hackathon project that stands out for its polished UX and robustness, and a production-ready foundation that can scale and adapt with confidence.
Implementation Steps for CLI AI Assistants (Claude/Codex)

1. **Install Coinbase SDKs**: Run `npm install @coinbase/onchainkit @coinbase/onchaintestkit` (OnchainKit for frontend, OnchainTestKit for testing). Also install Playwright (`npm install -D playwright`) if not included.
2. **Configure API Keys**: In your `.env` (or equivalent):
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_CDP_KEY = <Your OnchainKit API Key>` (for OnchainKit).
   - Set `COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY = <Your Coinbase Commerce API Key>` (for Commerce API calls).
3. **Create Coinbase Commerce Product**: In Coinbase Commerce dashboard, add a product for your NFT ticket (price in USDC). Note the `productId`.
4. **Add OnchainKit Provider**: Wrap your app with the OnchainKit provider. For example, in your main file:
   ```jsx
   import { OnchainKitProvider } from "@coinbase/onchainkit";
   // ...
   <OnchainKitProvider apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_CDP_KEY}>
     <App /> {/* your app's root component */}
   </OnchainKitProvider>;
   ```
   This initializes OnchainKit with your API key.
5. **Integrate Wallet Component**: In your header or wherever users connect wallets, use OnchainKit’s wallet UI:
   ```jsx
   import { Wallet, ConnectWallet } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/wallet";
   // ...
   <Wallet>
     <ConnectWallet /> {/* Renders a "Connect Wallet" button */}
   </Wallet>;
   ```
   Remove or toggle your old wallet connection logic once this is verified working.
6. **Embed USDC Checkout**: On your ticket purchase page, import OnchainKit’s checkout components:
   ```jsx
   import {
     Checkout,
     CheckoutButton,
     CheckoutStatus,
   } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/checkout";
   // Inside your component's return:
   <Checkout productId="<YOUR_PRODUCT_ID>">
     <CheckoutButton /> {/* Button to initiate payment */}
     <CheckoutStatus /> {/* Displays payment status */}
   </Checkout>;
   ```
   Replace `"<YOUR_PRODUCT_ID>"` with the productId from step 3. This adds a crypto payment button for the ticket.
7. **Secure Charge Creation (if needed)**: If you need dynamic pricing or metadata:
   - Create a backend route (e.g., `/api/createCharge`) that reads `amount` and `metadata` from the request and calls Coinbase Commerce API to create a charge (use `COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY` in the header)[13]. Return the `chargeId`.
   - In your frontend, on form submission (e.g., after user enters ticket quantity), POST to `/api/createCharge` with the total amount and any metadata (name, email, etc.)[31]. Receive the `chargeId` in response.
   - Redirect the user to `https://commerce.coinbase.com/charges/<chargeId>` or, if using OnchainKit’s Checkout, pass this `chargeId` into the Checkout flow (OnchainKit might handle it automatically when using productId, so this step is mainly for custom flows).
8. **Handle Payment Confirmation**: Set up a mechanism to know when payment is complete:
   - Easiest: Poll the charge status by GET `.../charges/<chargeId>` until `status: "COMPLETED"`[34].
   - Better: Use Coinbase Commerce webhooks – configure a webhook URL in your Coinbase Commerce settings. Implement a handler in your app to listen for `charge:confirmed` events and mark the ticket as paid (and trigger NFT mint).
   - Update UI: Once payment is confirmed (via webhook or polling), show a success message or navigate user to a confirmation page.
9. **Mint NFT on Payment Success**: On confirmation, mint the NFT to the buyer:
   - If you captured the buyer’s wallet address (from ConnectWallet or form input), call your smart contract’s mint function from backend. Use ethers.js with a signer (your server’s private key) to execute the mint transaction on Polygon.
   - Alternatively, if your contract supports it, use a meta-transaction or allow Coinbase’s operator to trigger the mint (advanced). Simpler is minting from your backend off the event.
   - Ensure this step is secure (only mint when a valid payment occurred) – cross-verify the `chargeId` and metadata (e.g., charge metadata contains the ticket ID or buyer info).
10. **Test End-to-End**: Use OnchainTestKit to write an automated test for the purchase flow:
    - Set up a local test environment: e.g., run a Hardhat node on Polygon fork or local network.
    - Launch your web app in headless browser via OnchainTestKit.
    - Simulate wallet connection and clicking the checkout button using OnchainTestKit’s Playwright controls[17].
    - Assert that a blockchain transaction was triggered and completed successfully (OnchainTestKit provides helpers like `expectTransactionSucceeded()`).
    - Verify post-conditions: e.g., the buyer’s address now owns the NFT (query contract), inventory reduced, etc.
    - Run `npx playwright test` (or similar) to execute the test. Ensure all tests pass.
11. **Gradual Rollout**: If everything looks good, enable the Coinbase Commerce payment in your app UI for real users (or demo). Keep your original purchase method available initially, as a fallback. Monitor for any issues during the hackathon demo or testing.
12. **Post-Hackathon Cleanup & Expansion**: After the event, consider:
    - Removing legacy payment methods if Coinbase flow is superior.
    - Adding Coinbase’s **Onramp** for users to buy crypto with fiat inside your app.
    - Expanding test coverage with OnchainTestKit for more scenarios (different browsers, wallets, error cases).
    - Utilizing Coinbase’s **Embedded Wallet** in the future to onboard non-crypto users with email login (no extension needed)[39][40].
    - Keeping dependencies updated (watch Coinbase’s announcements for updates to OnchainKit and OnchainTestKit).
