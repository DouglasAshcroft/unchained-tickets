# Scripts Overview

Operational and blockchain helper scripts now live in two subdirectories:

- `scripts/onchain/` – Hardhat and wallet tooling for deploying contracts or managing Base wallets.
- `scripts/ops/` – Operational utilities for seeding data, retrying charges, lighthouse reporting, and local developer helpers.

Run scripts with `npx tsx`/`node` as appropriate. Each folder should contain its own README if additional setup is required.
