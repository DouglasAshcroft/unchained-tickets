# Onchain Scripts

Utilities for deploying and maintaining smart contracts on Base.

- `deploy.cjs` – Deploy the Unchained Tickets contract (run via Hardhat).
- `initialize-production-contract.ts` – Populate contract metadata and events.
- `check-balance.cjs` – Inspect wallet balances before deployment.
- `generate-wallet.cjs` – Create a new wallet/private key pair.

Run these commands from the repository root so relative imports resolve correctly.
